# DotNet Web Api Boilerplate
This was created by following the "build-web-api-aspnet-core" exercise from Microsoft. This is a personal reference, so it will include notations to things that aren't immediately apprarent to me.

# DotNet gitignore file
I couldn't find an option on GitHub for a default dotnet git ignore file. I opted to use the one provided by .net 6 sdk.
```
dotnet new gitignore
```
